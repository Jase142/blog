					About Me
Hello! I'm Jason Harvey, and I have 2.5 years of experience working in IT Helpdesk. Throughout my career,
I've developed a strong foundation in IT support and an expanding knowledge of cloud technologies. 
I'm actively learning and experimenting with AWS, where I can confidently write and deploy websites.

In addition to my cloud endeavors, I've gained hands-on experience with various IT tools. I've tried setting
up SQL databases, although I encountered challenges in connecting them, which has only fueled my determination
to master database management.

A significant area of interest for me is cybersecurity. I've become proficient in setting up WAZUH,
a robust log platform that offers insights and suggestions for enhancing the security of operating systems.
This is a field I'm passionate about and intend to pursue further.

My technical skill set is rounded out with solid knowledge of Python and JavaScript,
enabling me to tackle a wide range of projects and challenges.

Thank you for visiting my blog, and I look forward to sharing my journey and insights with you!
